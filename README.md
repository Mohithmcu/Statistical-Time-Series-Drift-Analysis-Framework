# Statistical-Time-Series-Drift-Analysis-Framework
Built a statistical analysis framework to identify behavioral changes in time-series data without using machine learning. The system compares data across temporal windows using descriptive statistics and distribution measures to detect drift, producing clear and explainable summaries of when and how data patterns change.
